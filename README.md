# Immersal Visual Positioning AR Game

A location-based augmented reality application that leverages **Immersal Visual Positioning System (VPS)** to enable persistent, spatially accurate virtual content anchored to real-world environments.

---

## Overview

This project implements a detective-style augmented reality experience where digital objects are permanently attached to mapped physical locations.

Unlike GPS-based AR systems, positioning is achieved through **visual localization**, enabling centimeter-level spatial alignment and stable anchor persistence across sessions.

The system demonstrates how real-world spatial mapping and visual positioning technologies can be integrated into interactive gameplay mechanics.
